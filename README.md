# üëÅÔ∏è Face Detection Software

This is a Python-based face detection project using OpenCV to identify human faces in images and live video streams. It's designed as a beginner-friendly tool that can be extended into more advanced applications like facial recognition or attendance tracking.

## 1. Features

1. Detects faces in images and webcam video.
2. Displays bounding boxes around detected faces.
3. Runs in real-time (performance depends on your system).
4. Easy to set up and use.
5. Extendable to facial recognition, age/gender prediction, etc.

## 2. Technologies Used

1. Python 3.x  
2. OpenCV  
3. NumPy  
4. Optional: Tkinter or PyQt for GUI (if added)

## 3. Future Plans

1. Facial recognition (match known identities).
2. Dataset creation from detected faces.
3. Emotion detection.
4. Age and gender prediction.
5. Support for missing person databases.

## 4. Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-software.git
   cd face-detection-software
